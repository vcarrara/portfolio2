                        Victor was working in my team as an intern in 2019. His task was to prototype some new user interface architecture for our BBj product
                        platform. His ability to understand quickly, combined with his solid knowledge and expertise, allowed him to quickly deliver valuable
                        results which exceeded our expectations. He was able to successfully combine field knowledge of software development practices and
                        architecture with concrete development work in our Java-based BBj environment and in HTML5, JavaScript, and React components in
                        particular. Victor will be an asset for most any professional team that can make use of his energy, high work ethics, and knowledge. He
                        will always find open doors in my team, should our ways ever cross again.
